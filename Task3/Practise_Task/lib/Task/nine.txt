1. Bubble Sort

--> Time Complexity:
        Best Case: 𝑂(n) : Occurs when the array is already sorted.
        Worst Case: 𝑂(n^2) : Occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order.
        Average Case: 𝑂(n^2) : Average scenario where elements are in random order.

-------------------- 
2. Selection Sort

--> Time Complexity:
        Best Case: 𝑂(n^2) : No matter the order of elements, it always requires 𝑛−1 comparisons.
        Worst Case: 𝑂(n^2) : Similar to the best case, as it always performs 𝑛(𝑛−1)/2 comparisons.
        Average Case: 𝑂(n^2) : The number of comparisons remains constant regardless of the initial order of elements.

-------------------- 
3. Insertion  Sort

--> Time Complexity:
        Best Case: 𝑂(n) : Occurs when the array is already sorted.
        Worst Case: 𝑂(n^2) : Occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order.
        Average Case: 𝑂(n^2) : On average, requires about  n^2 / 4 comparisons and shifts.
