1. Linear Search

--> Time Complexity:
        Best Case: 𝑂(1) : The element is found at the first position.
        Worst Case: 𝑂(n) : The element is at the last position or not present at all.
        Average Case: 𝑂(n) : On average, it will check half of the elements in the list.

-------------------- 
2. Binary Search

--> Time Complexity:
        Best Case: 𝑂(1) : The element is found in the middle of the list on the first comparison.
        Worst Case: 𝑂(log(n)) : The search space is halved with each comparison until the element is found or the search space is empty.
        Average Case: 𝑂(log(n)) : The average number of comparisons is logarithmic in relation to the number of elements.
